# Word to Binary ASCII Converter

## Overview
The **Word to Binary ASCII Converter** is a Java application that converts user-inputted words or phrases into their corresponding binary ASCII representations. This project demonstrates fundamental programming concepts such as character encoding, user input handling, and the use of data structures like HashMap.

## Features
- **Character Mapping**: Converts uppercase letters (A-Z), lowercase letters (a-z), digits (0-9), and special characters to their binary ASCII values.
- **User Interaction**: Provides a console interface for user input and displays the binary representation of each character.
- **Robust Error Handling**: Informs users if any entered character is not included in the ASCII mapping.

## Technical Details
- **Programming Language**: Java
- **Data Structure**: HashMap for efficient character-to-binary mapping.
- **Key Classes**:
  - **ASCII**: Manages character mappings and binary conversions.
  - **Main**: The entry point for the application, handling user input and output.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
   cd your-repo-name
   ```

2. Compile and run the `Main` class:
   ```bash
   javac Main.java
   java Main
   ```

3. Enter a word or phrase when prompted. The application will output the binary representation for each character in the input.

## Supported Characters
- Uppercase letters: A-Z
- Lowercase letters: a-z
- Digits: 0-9
- Special characters: includes space (' '), punctuation, and symbols like '!', '@', '#', etc.

## Purpose
This project serves as an educational tool for understanding character encoding, Java programming, and principles of data structures and user interaction in software development.
